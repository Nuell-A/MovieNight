# Remote Movie Nights
Created mostly for personal use to watch movies with friends/family at a distance. 
My reason for this is that already available options are a bit slow so I will try to fix that issue with this one. 

**Tech**: Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, WebRTC, SocketIO

- SocketIO provides communication between client and server.
- WebRTC is used for peer-to-peer video/audio streaming.

### Needs:
- In need of further error handling.
- Front-end is not my specialty so a nicer front-end?
- Additional logic to stop capture screen and to stop sharing screen to peers.
- Currently if a user join after the screen-sharing has started, then they won't see the stream.
- Documentation.
